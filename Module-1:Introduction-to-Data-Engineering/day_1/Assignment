43 10 * * * rsync -av /home/hirafatima/tasks/assignment.log /home/hirafatima/xloop

in the above line of code i have copied a file named "assignmnet.log"  which is located in the sub directory, to the other folder named "xloop". 

rsync will copy the file and save in cache as well in order to fast copy the file for the next time. 

it will backup this file everyday at 10:43am. I used default  values for the date_of_month month and day_of_week which means it backup the file everyday.
