Comments: Mostly correct solution :) You missed following points:

* testing could have been improved a bit (but it's mostly good :))

* [best practices] your `label_encoder` function is responsible for more than one thing â€“ it would be good to eg. have separate function for transforming a single column
* [best practices] you could have added an assertion to verify the correctness of passed columns' names
